## Usage
In order to use this template for yourself, there are a few things that you will need to keep in mind.

### Hosting the YouTube chat listener remotely
The bundled `chat_listener.py` script can be deployed on another machine and exposed over HTTP so
your Minecraft server only needs to poll a public URL. This is especially handy when you host the
listener on Hack Club's Nest platform where Caddy is provided out of the box.

1. Copy `src/main/resources/python/chat_listener.py` to the machine that will run the listener.
2. Install the optional dependencies you need (for example `pytchat` and `python-socketio`).
3. Decide on a directory for the service (e.g. `/opt/youtube-listener`) and place the script there.
4. (Optional) Create `/etc/youtube-listener.env` and set any secrets such as
   `STREAMLABS_SOCKET_TOKEN=...`.
5. Install the sample systemd unit from [`config/systemd/youtube-chat-listener.service`](config/systemd/youtube-chat-listener.service)
   and adjust the `WorkingDirectory`, `ExecStart`, `User` and `Group` directives to match your
   environment. The example unit is intended for a system service; if you prefer a user service,
   place it under `~/.config/systemd/user/` and adjust the commands accordingly. Reload the systemd
   daemon and enable the service:

   ```bash
   sudo cp config/systemd/youtube-chat-listener.service /etc/systemd/system/
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable --now youtube-chat-listener.service
   ```

6. When running behind Nest's Caddy instance, configure a reverse proxy so the listener is available
   on your public subdomain. The example [`config/caddy/youtube-listener.Caddyfile`](config/caddy/youtube-listener.Caddyfile)
   targets a listener bound to `127.0.0.1:8081` using the path prefix `/yt-listener`. Replace the
   placeholder domain with your actual host name (without an `http://` prefix) so Caddy can obtain
   certificates automatically, then reload Caddy: `sudo systemctl reload caddy`.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è For local development you can temporarily use `http://localhost`, but for public deployments
> you should rely on Caddy's automatic HTTPS to keep the listener secured.

The listener now understands the `--http-path-prefix` flag, allowing it to serve multiple paths such
as `/yt-listener` and `/yt-listener/events`, which plays nicely with Caddy route matchers. In the
plugin's `config.yml`, set `youtube.listener-url` to the HTTPS URL that Caddy exposes (for example
`https://example.hackclub.app/yt-listener/events`).

### TikTok listener integration
Alongside the YouTube bridge the plugin now supports events sourced from a TikTok listener. The new
`tiktok` block in `config.yml` mirrors the existing YouTube options so you can point the bridge at a
polling URL or external process, and `tiktok-bridge` exposes per-platform behaviour toggles (chat
commands, follower milestones, and gift-triggered orbital strikes). Use the `/ttstream` management
command to update the listener identifier or target player in-game:

```text
/ttstream setchat <listenerUrl>
/ttstream settarget <player>
/ttstream reload
```

Players who should receive TikTok chat relays require the `example.ttstream.monitor` permission
while administrators can manage the integration with `example.ttstream.use`. The plugin persists
follower counts to `tiktok-bridge-state` so milestone celebrations survive restarts just like the
YouTube bridge.

### Browser Overlay for OBS
When the HTTP endpoint is running, the listener also serves a lightweight overlay that you can add
as an OBS browser source. Point the source at the `/overlay` path matching your prefix, for example:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8081/yt-listener/overlay
```

The overlay polls the `/events` endpoint, formats subscriber alerts in a Streamlabs-like card
(`{NAME} subscribed! Spawned 1 TNT.`), and shows the latest chat messages. Enable a transparent
background in OBS and place the browser source wherever you want alerts to appear on stream.

### Donation Orbital Strike
The plugin now reacts to Streamlabs donation events. By default any $5+ YouTube donation (currency
match is configurable) unleashes the **Orbital Strike Cannon**: 100 TNT spawns above the configured
target player and their screen flashes with a custom title. To tweak thresholds or visuals, edit the
`youtube-bridge.donations` section in `config.yml`‚Äîyou can change the minimum amount, TNT count,
spawn height, wave size, or the title text (use placeholders like `{donor}`, `{formatted_amount}`,
and `{tnt_count}`). Trigger the Streamlabs ‚ÄúTest Donation‚Äù button to verify the full pipeline before
going live.

### Release Info
#### PaperMC Version Mapping
Here's a list of the PaperMC versions and the versions of this latest compatible version.

| PaperMC | ExamplePlugin |
|---------|---------------|
| 1.21.1  | 4.0.2         |
| 1.21    | 3.12.1        |
| 1.20.6  | 3.11.0        |
| 1.19.4  | 3.2.1         |
| 1.18.2  | 3.0.2         |
| 1.17.1  | 2.2.0         |
| 1.16.5  | 2.1.2         |

This chart would make more sense if this plugin actually did anything and people would have a reason
to be looking for older releases to run on older servers.

To use this as a template, just use the latest version of this project and update the PaperMC
version as needed. See more info on release stability below.

#### Release and Versioning Strategy
Stable versions of this repo are tagged `vX.Y.Z` and have an associated [release](https://github.com/CrimsonWarpedcraft/plugin-template/releases).

Testing versions of this repo are tagged `vX.Y.Z-RC-N` and have an associated [pre-release](https://github.com/CrimsonWarpedcraft/plugin-template/releases).

Development versions of this repo are pushed to the master branch and are **not** tagged.

| Tag `vX.Y.Z-RC-N` | X.Y.Z-SNAPSHOT        | Build, test, release, and notify | Pre-release           |
| Tag `vX.Y.Z`      | X.Y.Z                 | Build, test, release, and notify | Release               |

### Discord Notifications
In order to use Discord notifications, you will need to create two GitHub secrets. `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID` 
should be set to the id of your Discord webhook. `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TOKEN` will be the token for the webhook.

You can find these values by copying the Discord Webhook URL:  
`https://discord.com/api/webhooks/<DISCORD_WEBHOOK_ID>/<DISCORD_WEBHOOK_TOKEN>`

Optionally, you can also configure `DISCORD_RELEASE_WEBHOOK_ID` and `DISCORD_RELEASE_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`
to send release announcements to a separate channel.

For more information, see [Discord Message Notify](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/discord-message-notify).

## Creating a Release
Below are the steps you should follow to create a release.

1. Create a tag on `main` using semantic versioning (e.g. v0.1.0)
2. Push the tag and get some coffee while the workflows run
3. Publish the release draft once it's been automatically created

## Building locally
Thanks to [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), building locally is easy no matter what platform you're on. Simply run the following command:

```text
./gradlew build
```

This build step will also run all checks and tests, making sure your code is clean.

JARs can be found in `build/libs/`.
